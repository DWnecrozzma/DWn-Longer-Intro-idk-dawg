# Ello ! (again)
as yuo know, Im DWnecrozzma!!1! call me by any variation of my username idk as long as it's not just hella rude or anything<br><br>

im ofc, multifandom, check my fandom respiratory if yuo curious about my fandoms. i also don't give a fudge about pronouns because my original language don't even have gendered pronouns<br><br>

also i make deliberate typos and spam emojis for extra comedic effect, so just look out for that I guezz<br><br>

anywasy, hobbies? drawing, thats it, just drawing, it's my life atp, there's a reason why i kin itsuki from bokuyona yk yk<br>(maybe I like coding a little too)<br><br>
speaking of bokuyona, it's currently my biggest hyperfixation, so just expect me to constantly reference it (or run around with bokuyona skins in pt) alongside with namari hime
<br><br>
okau sso boundaries: freakiness towards me is okay AS LONG AS IT'S PLAYED AS A JOKE, im not accepting people who wants to actually f me for real esp how im still a minor, also for the dni list just expect the usual one people have
